 **Code Institute - Fullstack Web Developer Course**

-**First Milestone Project**

This website was created as the first milestone project of the course after the completion of the Module: User-Centric Frontend Development.

The portfolio was designed for my own personal work as an event decorator.
The goal was to create a simple and clear page, which would be lighter and more concise than my company's website, in order to give a quicker introduction to my work.

You can see the website in GitHub pages

## Features

The website consists of four pages:
- the Welcome Page
- the About-me Page
- the Projects Page
- the Contact Page

Each of them has a responsive design and a full size photo as a background, acting as a unifying theme throughout the website. 
The navigation bar includes my name on the left, which acts as a link to the Welcome Page, and the names of the other three pages on the right, which also link to the respective page.
The footer contains my slogan an the left and the links to my company's website and social media accounts on the right.

The Welcome Page includes a big background image of a bride and groom, the description of my work on top and a welcome message on the bottom.
The minimal design aims to draw the eye to the impressive photo, to create a strong emotional response and invite the user to explore further.

The About-me Page includes a small photo of me an the left and a short text describing who I am on the right, under the title "Who I am".

The Projects Page includes a description of the work I do on the left and a photo gallery on the right, under the title "What I do".
Each image in the gallery is a link to a different category of projects in my company's website.

The Contact Page includes a big inviting title, "Send me a message", and a contact form over a photo of a reception table with vibrant colors.
In the future I would like to link the form to send an email to my company's email address.
