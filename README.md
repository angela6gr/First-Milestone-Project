 **Code Institute - Fullstack Web Developer Course**

-**First Milestone Project**

This website was created as the first milestone project of the course after the completion of the Module: User-Centric Frontend Development.

The portfolio was designed for my own personal work as an event decorator.
The goal was to create a simple and clear page, which would be lighter and more concise than my company's website, in order to give a quicker introduction to my work.
I wanted to create a memorable page, which is vilually appealing and inviting and captures the attention of the users, making them curious about my work.

You can see the website in GitHub pages [here](https://github.com/angela6gr/First-Milestone-Project)

## Features

The website consists of four pages:
- the Welcome Page

- the About-me Page

- the Projects Page

- the Contact Page

Each of them has a responsive design and a full size photo as a background, acting as a unifying theme throughout the website. 
The navigation bar includes my name on the left, which acts as a link to the Welcome Page, and the names of the other three pages on the right, which also link to the respective page.
The footer contains my slogan on the left and the links to my company's website and social media accounts on the right.

The Welcome Page includes a big background image of a bride and groom, the description of my work on top and a welcome message on the bottom.
The minimal design aims to draw the eye to the impressive photo, to create a strong emotional response and invite the user to explore further.

The About-me Page includes a small photo of me an the left and a short text describing who I am on the right, under the title "Who I am".

The Projects Page includes a description of the work I do on the left and a photo gallery on the right, under the title "What I do".
Each image in the gallery is a link to a different category of projects in my company's website.

The Contact Page includes a big inviting title, "Send me a message", and a contact form over a photo of a reception table with vibrant colors.
In the future I would like to link the form to send an email to my company's email address.



## UX

# Design Choices

The website aims to capture the attention of potential clients, by focusing more on the images rather than the text. I made the decision to use large photos as background in all the pages, in order to both create a common element throughout the website and, most importantly, to enhance the user's visual experience by focusing on the images to provide the first impession. As the subject of the website is about event decoration, a field that itself creates emotion-provoking designs and visualisation, the large photos, especially of the bride and groom in the Welcome page, allow for a more immersive experience and a better connecton to the user.
To further illustrate this, the links to my work in the Projects page are also images of my creations. 

I added a maximum width of 1400px to the website and a background color for larger screens, as the images do not look as nice on such large screens.

Adobe XD was used for the wireframe of the website. You can view it here: [Mockup](https://xd.adobe.com/view/bf6598a4-f4f3-445b-5cd0-cc320a72cd5c-c954/)

# Colors

As large pistures serve as the background of the pages, I chose a dark color for the navigation bar and footer, in order to contrast the lighter colors within the images. The almost black shade (Eerie Black) serves as a neutral dark and modern choise that frames the lagre images, which are full of colors themselves. 
The font color on the navigation bar and the footer (Middle Blue Green) contrasts well with the dark background making the words easy to read, remaining at the same time discreet and fresh without distracting from the images.
To add a pop of color to the design I chose the Fiery Rose shade for the title text of every page. I found this to combine well with the other colors with the help of the Coolors generator, as seen below.

# Fonts



## Technologies Used

- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)
- [Responsive Website Design Tester](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/)

## Version Control

Github was used to track code changes. If you look at my commit history you will see a 15 month gap between May 2020 and September 2021. This is because of life circumstances gracing me with the responsibility of bringing a new life into the world during a pandemic and taking a leave of absence from the course. Luckily due all my changes being in the same repository, I could easily jump right back into things and read my commit history to refresh myself with the changes I had made over time. 



## Testing

The HTML code has been validated using the [W3C Mark-up Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).  
The CSS code has been validated using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).  
The responsiveness of the website was tested using the [Responsive Website Design Tester](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/).

All the links in this wesite, except those in the navigation bar, will open in a new tab, so that the user doesn't leave the page when clicking them. The have been tested and they lead to the correct dectination. 

You can see the responsive features of the website in the pictures below:

## Defects

1. On the projects page, where images are used as links to my work, the grid doesn't  work so well between a screen width of 768px and 1300px. It has been very challenging to get it to look more beautiful. It has been an ambitious grid for me from the beginning and it's something I intend to come back and perfect as I move along in the course and my knowledge deepens.
2. The social media icons split in to two rows between the screen widths of 576px and 768px. 

## Deployment

The website was developed using Gitpod and GitHub and deployed using GitHub Pages.

The process is as follows:
1. I created a new repository by cklicking the button 'New' on the right side of the page.

In order to do this by using the gitpod-full-template from the Code Institute, one has to start here https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template and click 'Use this as template'

2. After naming the repository First Milestone Project, I clicked on 'Gitpod' to open the workspace where the code is to be written.

## Credits

All the photos used in the website are either taken by my or used with the permission of the photographer.
All the text was written by me. 

The following websites and their tutorials were the main source of help throughout the coding of my page:
- [W3Schools Online Web Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

I was also inspired and helped by the course material of the Code Intitute and especially the mini project creating an online resume.

Special thanks to my sister Christina Kyratzidou for her time looking over my design, font and photo selection and above all to my mentors Maranatha Ilesanmi and Malia Havlicek for their time, guidance and advice.
