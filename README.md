 **Code Institute - Fullstack Web Developer Course**

-**First Milestone Project**

This website was created as the first milestone project of the course after the completion of the Module: User-Centric Frontend Development.

The portfolio was designed for my own personal work as an event decorator.
The goal was to create a simple and clear page, which would be lighter and more concise than my company's website, in order to give a quicker introduction to my work.

You can see the website in GitHub pages [here](https://github.com/angela6gr/First-Milestone-Project)

## Features

The website consists of four pages:
- the Welcome Page

- the About-me Page
- the Projects Page

- the Contact Page

Each of them has a responsive design and a full size photo as a background, acting as a unifying theme throughout the website. 
The navigation bar includes my name on the left, which acts as a link to the Welcome Page, and the names of the other three pages on the right, which also link to the respective page.
The footer contains my slogan on the left and the links to my company's website and social media accounts on the right.

The Welcome Page includes a big background image of a bride and groom, the description of my work on top and a welcome message on the bottom.
The minimal design aims to draw the eye to the impressive photo, to create a strong emotional response and invite the user to explore further.

The About-me Page includes a small photo of me an the left and a short text describing who I am on the right, under the title "Who I am".

The Projects Page includes a description of the work I do on the left and a photo gallery on the right, under the title "What I do".
Each image in the gallery is a link to a different category of projects in my company's website.

The Contact Page includes a big inviting title, "Send me a message", and a contact form over a photo of a reception table with vibrant colors.
In the future I would like to link the form to send an email to my company's email address.



## UX

The website aims to capture the attention of potential clients, by focusing more on the images rather than the text. I made the decision to use large photos as background in all the pages, in order to both create a common element throughout the website and, most importantly, to enhance the user's visual experience by focusing on the images to provide the first impession. As the subject of the website is about event decoration, a field that itself creates emotion-provoking designs and visualisation, the large photos, especially of the bride and groom in the Welcome page, allow for a more immersive experience and a better connecton to the user.
To further illustrate this, the links to my work in the Projects page are also images of my creations.

Adobe XD was used for the wireframe of the website. You can view it here: [Mockup](https://xd.adobe.com/view/bf6598a4-f4f3-445b-5cd0-cc320a72cd5c-c954/)

## Version Control

Github was used to track code changes. If you look at my commit history you will see a 15 month gap between May 2020 and September 2021. This is because of life circumstances gracing me with the responsibility of bringing a new life into the world during a pandemic and taking a leave of absence from the course. Luckily due all my changes being in the same repository, I could easily jump right back into things and read my commit history to refresh myself with the changes I had made over time. 



## Testing

The HTML code has been validated using the [W3C Mark-up Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).  
The CSS code has been validated using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).  
The responsiveness of the website was tested using the [Responsive Website Design Tester](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/).

All the links in this wesite, except those in the navigation bar, will open in a new tab, so that the user doesn't leave the page when clicking them. The have been tested and they lead to the correct dectination. 

## Deployment

The website was developed using Gitpod and GitHub and deployed using GitHub Pages.

## Credits

All the photos used in the website are either taken by my or used with the permission of the photographer.
All the text was written by me. 

The following websites and their tutorials were the main source of help throughout the coding of my page:
- [W3Schools Online Web Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

I was also inspired and helped by the course material of the Code Intitute and especially the mini project creating an online resume.

Special thanks to my sister Christina Kyratzidou for her time looking over my design, font and photo selection and above all to my mentors Maranatha Ilesanmi and Malia Havlicek for their time, guidance and advice.
